# Pain points
Before developing a front-end project, we may need to do the following preparationsÔºö
- Set up a development environment
- Conventional code specification
- Encapsulate API requests
- Configure routing
- Realize layout, menu, navigation
- Realize login
- authority management
- ...

In addition to the preparation work, there are many similar business types. For example, most of the middle and back-end applications are workbenches, additions, deletions, changes, permissions, charts, etc. If each project is completely processed manually, it will not only take time, but over time there may be multiple technology stacks and development specifications, leading to inconsistent development processes and making historical projects more and more difficult to maintain. So we need a complete solution to manage the entire process from development to deployment.


## Fes.js Ôºü
Fes.js is an excellent front-end application solution. Fes.js is based on Vue 3.0 and routing, and supports both configuration routing and convention routing, which can be used for functional expansion. Equipped with a complete plug-in system covering the compile-time and runtime life cycle, it supports various function extensions and business requirements.    

It mainly has the following functions:
- üöÄ  __fast__ , Built-in routing, development, construction, etc., and provide plug-ins such as testing, layout, permissions, internationalization, state management, API requests, data dictionary, SvgIcon, etc., which can meet most of the daily development needs.  
  
- üß®  __easy__ , Based on Vue.js 3.0, easy to get started. Carry out the idea of "Convention is better than configuration", design plug-ins as much as possible to replace configuration with conventions, and provide a unified plug-in configuration entry, which is simple, concise and flexible. Provide a consistent API entry, a consistent experience, and easier learning.

- üí™  __strong__ , Only need to care about the content of the page, reduce the chance of writing BUG! Provide unit testing and coverage testing capabilities to ensure project quality.

- üì¶  __expanded__ , Drawing lessons from Umi, it implements a complete life cycle and plug-in mechanism. The plug-in can manage the compile time and runtime of the project, and the capabilities can be encapsulated through the plug-in, and run in an orderly manner in Fes.js.

- üì°  __future__ , While meeting demand, we will not stop exploring new technologies. Vue3.0 has been used to improve application performance, webpack5 has been used to improve construction performance and implement microservices, and new technologies such as vite will be explored in the future.
